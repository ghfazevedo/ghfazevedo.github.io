      title: Research Areas
      text: <p style="color:#000000 ">My research aims to reveal patterns and processes underlying the diversity and distribution of organisms across scales. By using, adapting and developing analytical tools that connect micro- and macro-evolutionary aspects of evolution, I combine concepts and theories from disciplines, such as population genetics, phylogenetics, ecology and biogeography. More specifically, I am interested in (1) using population level processes informed by genomic data to better understand phenotypic evolution; (2) understanding the role of sexual selection and introgression on speciation and the evolution of sex related traits; (3) studying how genome, phenotype, geography and environment interact with each other to generate and maintain biodiversity; and (4) how anthropogenic induced changes impact genetic and taxonomic diversity.
