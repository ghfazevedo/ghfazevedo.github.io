      title: Phenotypic evolution through the lens of population genetics processes
      subtitle: ''
      text: <p style="color:#000000 "> In addition to providing more robust phylogenetic hypotheses, phylogenomic studies also bring insights about how molecular evolution and population genetics processes are linked to phenotypic evolution and systematics. For instance, when ancestral population sizes are ignored, the analyses of phenotypic evolution can mislead conclusions about processes, such as mistaking convergence from drift or balancing selection deep in the past. Despite its importance, the connection between molecular and phenotypic evolution is rarely considered in trait evolution studies. My research investigate how population genetics theory informed by genomic data is linked to trait evolution in spiders. The foundations for this research come from my previous works, where I found that phenotypes related to web-less lifestyle in spiders could be mistaken as convergent evolution when in fact it is likely to be a homologous trait resultant from population process in the past (hemiplasy). I also developed a novel bioinformatic pipeline that combines coalescent and discrete trait evolution models for studying the probability of hemiplasy. The combined use of phenotypes and genomics with approaches that better link molecular and morphological evolution can help us to elucidate phylogenetic relationships and better test evolutionary processes.</p> <p>![Graphical Abstract](./featured.jpg) </p>
